# Spaceship Crash Environment

 This Unreal Engine project is a work-in-progress environment that incorporates procedural asset and material workflows as part of my personal study of technical art.

 Some things this includes:

 - Procedural terrain generated in Houdini and implemented in Unreal Engine
 - Multi-layered landscape material system driven by splat maps generated in Houdini along with terrain heightmap.
 - Trim sheets created procedurally in Substance Designer
 - Vertex-paintable damage, weathering and grime
 - Texturing/material workflows for large-scale props
 - Other procedural workflows, such as decal placement, mask-driven material variants, and more.
